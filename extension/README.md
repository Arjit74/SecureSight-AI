- 🌐 **Backend Integration** – Connects to GuardianLink dashboard for advanced threat checks
- 🛑 **Smart Blocking** – Blocks dangerous URLs instantly or shows warnings
- 📊 **Dashboard Sync** – Logs all analyzed URLs to your account
- 🔐 **Privacy First** – All URL analysis uses encryption; no browsing history stored

2. Try reloading the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
